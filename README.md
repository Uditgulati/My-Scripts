A repo for all of the scripts that i have created so far. Some are written in Bash, others in Python.

## Scripts written so far--

### Bash

+	**udit** - A simple script that takes contest name as input and goes to that folder, removes previous files, creates new files using predefined template.

	+	**Usage** - copy file **udit** to folder "/usr/local/bin/" and **file1.cpp**, **file2.cpp** to "~/Documents/Format/". Run command `udit <Contest_Name>`.
